# Association Rule - Market Basket Analysis

The Apriori algorithm generates association rules. An association rule says that if product 1 occurs, then product 2 occurs with a certain probability. One such application of association rules is market basket analysis.

What do my customer buy? What did they buy together? These are the common question or analysis to be made. These analysis revel what people buy together and then can be used to create appropriate promotions or placements of the product in the store.
